### About me
I'm a Developer backend PHP Jr | Laravel | Javascript

Active member of the Brazilian Navy since 2011

With militarism, discipline and hierarchy became the basis of everything.
In order to always evolve, I continued to acquire knowledge.
In the navy, I took on functions of system development and maintenance of Linux servers (Oracle and Suse) and use of the drupal CMS for administration of internal and external sites.

I am looking to improve my English to allow me to explore the world through development.

Keeping up with and exploring the world of PHP with LARAVEL + LIVEWIRE
